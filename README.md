# Low-power Wireless PPG BLE Patch

This project implements a **wearable patch** for physiological signal acquisition, focusing on **Photoplethysmography (PPG)** and **Electrocardiography (ECG)** with **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** connectivity.  
Built around the **ADPD1080 Analog Front-End** and **STM32WB55 MCU**, it supports low-power operation from coin cells.

## ðŸ’» Firmware Overview

The **Firmware** folder contains:
- **ADPDEvaluation and Setup** â€” Arduino code for ESP32 to interface with the ADPD1080 evaluation board and connect directly to a PC.  
  - Uses `ADPD1080regconfig.py` to generate register values from parameterized input and instantly write them to the device.  
  - ESP32 continuously fetches readings and sends them via a UDP server.  
  - Data reception handled by `ServerRecieve22.py` (2-value mode) and `ServerRecieve66.py` (6-value FIFO mode).  
  - This setup enables quick testing of different register configurations to identify optimal sensor parameters.  
- Each receive script generates a **CSV** file, which can be processed using the provided MATLAB scripts for signal analysis.  
- **Final Firmware** â€” Complete STM32WB55 code is provided, which accesses data from the ADPD1080 AFE and streams it over BLE to an Android device for real-time monitoring and logging.
